# User Story Description

## Structure of a User Story

As a _type of user_, I want _goal_ or _feature_ so that _reason_ or _benefit_.

For example:

- As a new user, I want to be able to register with my email so that I can access personalized content.
- As a returning customer, I want to see my order history so that I can easily reorder items.

## Key Components
* Role (Type of User): Defines who is requesting the feature (e.g., admin, registered user, guest).
* Goal/Action: Describes what the user wants to do.
* Benefit: Explains why the feature is valuable to the user.

## Adding Detail with Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria define the conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete. For example:

- The order history displays the last 10 orders.
- Each order shows the date, items purchased, and total cost.
